1,Early Sranan,,5.833333,-55.6,sran1240,,"Over the years multiple historical documents in and on the English-base creole language of Suriname known as Sranan or Sranantongo have been uncovered, resulting in a substantial digitized corpus of eighteenth-century texts. These texts, stored in the Suriname Creole Archive at the Radboud University, Nijmegen, provide a unique window on the Sranan language as it was spoken in the eighteenth century, that is, at earlier stages of its development. In several historical sources phonological, grammatical, semantic, and pragmatic differences between varieties of the creole language are acknowledged, and some varieties appear to have been so different that they are known under distinct names. For example, in Schumann’s Sranan–German dictionary of 1783, we find references to Plantasi tongo (Plantation language), Foto tongo (City language), Ningre tongo (Black’s language) as well as English tongo (English language). Early Sranan is used as cover term for these 18th century creole varieties. Detailed comparisons of the historical creole data with their equivalents in contemporary varieties of Sranantongo and the Surinamese Maroon languages have further refined our understanding of language variation and language change in Early Sranan.  The default lect documented in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span> is the variety of Early Sranan that was used for interethnic out-group communication.

10,San Andres Creole English,,13.35,-81.366669,sana1297,icr,"San Andres Creole English is spoken in the archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina, Colombia, by no more but possibly considerably fewer than 20,000 speakers. The language is also spoken by diaspora communities located, most importantly, in mainland Colombia and, in second place, on the Central American Caribbean Coast, especially in Panama, and in the United States. The numbers of speakers and the extent to which the language is maintained in the diaspora is not known.

The two main varieties of the language are San Andres Creole proper (or Saintandrewan, as language activists call it) and Providence Creole English. At first sight, the distinguishing criterion appears to be geographical. However, we are dealing with structurally distinct varieties, and I believe that sociolectal variation in terms of a hypothetical creole continuum constitutes an even more important criterion: Providence Creole English is clearly a more acrolectal variety of Western Caribbean Creole English than San Andres Creole English. Unless otherwise specified, basilectal San Andres Creole English, i.e., the creole of the island of San Andres, constitutes the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">default lect</span> described here. Occasionally, reference is being made to Providence Creole English and a written lect ocurring in the very few teaching materials devised for San Andres Creole English.

San Andres Creole English constitutes a minority as well as a minorized language on the island. Over the past fifteen years, the little presence it had in the media has faded away and efforts by the Colombian Ministry of Education to start a nation-wide move towards bilingual education in Spanish and (Standard) English in San Andres and Providence further jeopardizes the timid pro-creole action taken since the 1980s and especially during the 1990s. Providence Creole English speakers never really embraced the idea of their creole being an autonomous variety, let alone a distinct language. I consider both San Andres and Providence Creole English to be more or less highly endangered.",bartensangela,bartensangela,"San Andres Creole English.

11,Nicaraguan Creole English,,12,-83.75,nica1251,bzk,"Nicaraguan Creole English (or Miskito Coast Creole English) is spoken as a first language by several groups of people: ethnic Creoles, the Rama, Nicaraguan Garifuna, and some Miskitos, and as a second language by other Miskitos and some Mestizos. It is mainly spoken (nowadays as a minority language) in the two Nicaraguan Autonomous Regions of the Atlantic Coast but also elsewhere in Nicaragua, the United States, and other small diaspora communities. Estimates of speaker numbers vary between 35,000 and 50,000.

Nicaraguan Creole English can be considered one of the oldest English-based varieties in the Americas. Belizean Creole constitutes a direct off-shoot of Nicaraguan Creole English which, on the other hand, has undergone influence from several other Western Caribbean Creoles, obscuring the genetic relationships of the creoles of the region in question.

Speakers themselves identify at least the variants of Bluefields, the Corn Islands, Pearl Lagoon, Rama Cay, Orinoco, and Bilwi. It is commonly felt that the urban variety of Bluefields should constitute the basis for standardization. On the other hand, Spanish is much more present in Bluefields than in rural communities. Over recent years, there have been signs that the Spanish–Creole English diglossia has started to leak. Nevertheless, it has been postulated that there continue to exist separate Anglo, ""costeño"" (coastal) and Black identities within the Creole population and those most closely identifying with the Anglo identity are unlikely to be in favor of bilingual Creole-Spanish programs any more than they were in the 1980s. Indeed, Standard English is valued not only as an international language but also as the foundation of that particular facet of Creole identity as a cross of a class and an ethnic position. 

The <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">default lect </span>in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span> is constituted by data gathered in Bluefields and surrounding locations in 2006-2007.

Even though Bahamians themselves often claim that “Nassau people don’t speak the Dialect,” this variety must be considered most representative of the creole at large, as roughly two thirds of all Bahamians now reside in Nassau. The data were recorded by myself in sociolinguistic interviews with mostly working-class speakers in the late 1990s. I also elicited a number of examples from five highly educated bidialectal speakers with the help of Dahl’s tense-mood-aspect questionnaire (1985).

The use of Krio in Sierra Leone has become more widespread since it was incorporated into the educational curriculum and is now one of the most popular languages taught in schools.

Of these, Cameroon Pidgin English is probably the most important one. All these languages (indigenous and official) exert an influence on Cameroon Pidgin English, and therefore variation in this language is determined by varying degrees of approximation to Cameroon English and to French at the acrolectal end (usually associated with educated speakers in urban environments) and varying degrees of influence from the indigenous languages at the basilectal end (usually associated with less educated speakers and rural areas).

19,Pichi,,3.754634,8.779449,fern1234,fpe,"Pichi is used as a home or vernacular language by the vast majority of the old-established population of the island of Bioko. It is most often used as a primary home language in the Equatoguinean capital Malabo (located on Bioko), as well as in Luba (the second largest agglomeration of Bioko). There are no language-specific census data on Equatorial Guinea. By extrapolation from population figures it may however be safe to assume that at least seventy percent of the population of Bioko, hence more than 150,000 people, use Pichi regularly. On one end, the lectal continuum of Pichi features a variety rather close to Sierra Leone Krio in terms of phonology, morphosyntax, lexicon and idiomatic usage. This variety tends to be characteristic of older speakers, who grew up in the centre of Malabo in the ambit of Fernandino creole culture. On the other end, we find a variety characterized by phonological and morphosyntactic innovation, the absence of older layers of Krio-derived vocabulary, some convergence with West African English lexifier creoles like Nigerian Pidgin, and considerable lexical and structural admixture from Spanish. This variety, which is the default lect documented in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span>, tends to be spoken by the younger urban working-class population of Malabo, often with a Bubi cultural background, who have adopted Pichi as a primary language, and whose families have been accultured in more recent decades into the Pichi-speaking urban culture of Malabo.

Sranan is spoken both as a first language and a lingua franca throughout the country and in western French Guiana. It is currently the native language of about 126,000 Surinamese, and a second (or third) language for most of the rest of the population of about 400,000. It is also estimated that most of the 200,000 people of Surinamese descent who now live in the Netherlands also speak Sranan. The varieties used by speakers there as well as by Dutch-dominant Surinamese have been influenced to varying degrees by Dutch. The varieties used by groups of Asian descent as well as by Amerindians also appear to have been influenced by the respective ethnic languages, though little research has been done to investigate such influences. There is also a great deal of variation in the language according to social class and status. In general, two primary varieties can be identified. One is the more conservative variety learnt as a first language by members of the working classes in poorer neighborhoods in Paramaribo, as well as in former plantation areas such as the Para District, Coronie, etc. These speakers are for the most part Afro-Surinamese, and refer to their vernacular as “Nengre” (Black Talk).

21,Singlish,,1.33,101.7,sing1262,,"Singapore English or Singlish is the variety used increasingly for everyday communication in Singapore, in particular in the younger generation. It functions within a complex multilingual ecology: while Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil are the three other official languages in addition to English, numerous other languages are also used by the ethnically heterogeneous population, including southern Chinese languages such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hakka and Hainanese, and South Asian languages such as Punjabi, Bengali, Malayalam, and Telegu. Singlish exists on a lectal continuum, where basilectal and mesolectal varieties combine strong elements of Chinese grammar with a lexicon of English origin, with rich Malay and Hokkien contribution, while at the acrolectal end convergence to standard – often British, increasingly American – English is sought. Influence from other varieties of English during the British colonial period such as Indian English and Peranakan English, significant elements in the early days of English-medium education, is also observable. The basilectal/mesolectal variety, which comprises both the varieties of those without English-medium education (in older generations) and the colloquial variety of Singapore English of the English-educated, is often referred to as Singlish, and is the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">default lect</span> documented in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span>.

Two recent observations are of note, significant in the light of Singlish being officially stigmatised in Singapore: The gap between the more acrolectal Standard Singapore English and the more mesolectal-basilectal Singlish appears to be diminishing, with the variety used in the more formal domains showing features – certainly in phonology but also morphosyntax – usually ascribed to Singlish.

22,Tok Pisin,,-9.5,147.166672,tokp1240,tpi,"Tok Pisin is an English-lexified pidgin/creole spoken in Papua New Guinea which has developed over the past 150 years or so. Sister dialects are spoken in neighbouring countries: Solomons Pijin in the Solomon Islands and Bislama in Vanuatu. The number of speakers of the language is difficult to determine accurately (as is the population of the country), but it is estimated that at least half of the approximately 6 million people of Papua New Guinea have at least a working knowledge of the language. The term Tok Pisin covers a wide range of both second and first language varieties, including some that are heavily influenced by English - especially in urban areas – or by indigenous languages. Nationally, Tok Pisin is predominantly spoken as a language in addition to either indigenous languages or English, and so bilingual effects in spoken language are commonplace. 

For many years Tok Pisin was spoken almost exclusively as a second language and used for a limited range of functions in this intensely multilingual area. In the past few decades, the number of speakers of creolized first language Tok Pisin has been rising steadily. Geoff Smith's own research was based on a corpus of transcribed speech of adolescents who spoke Tok Pisin as their first language, and this is the default lect used for judgements in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span>. However, it should be noted that within this corpus there are significant regional differences. Most of the published accounts of Tok Pisin are based on rural second language Tok Pisin, and much of the early work referred to the Madang area of north-east New Guinea. These sources have also occasionally been used for illustrative purposes.

Varieties of Tok Pisin are regularly used in radio and television broadcasts, in government and NGO communications and in commercial advertising as well as in the weekly published <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Wantok</span> newspaper.

Like other English-lexified creole languages of the Pacific, Kriol originates in the English-based pidgin used between the first colonizers and the indigenous inhabitants of the Sydney area, which subsequently spread inland and north. Many authors assume that creolization occurred abruptly early in the 20th century at an Anglican mission at Roper River (close to the present-day Ngukurr) through children from different language backgrounds who had been brought together in dormitories; for this reason Kriol is often referred to as Roper River Kriol. There is however evidence that the pidgin had already stabilized and linguistically expanded at that time, due to the need for communication between the increasing numbers of Aboriginal people working on cattle stations, the (primarily) English-speaking pastoralists, and the non-English-speaking (e.g. Chinese) colonists in a wider area.

The creole is normally used in urban areas and in commerce in rural areas, where local languages predominate.  There is a triglossic situation in which Guinea-Bissau Kriyol occupies the middle position in a pyramid between Portuguese at the top with fewer speakers but with more prestige, and with the African languages at the bottom with the greatest total number of speakers but with the least prestige. Researchers such as Alain Kihm and Jean-Louis Rougé agree that Guinea-Bissau Kriyol has regional varieties, the main ones being that of Cacheu and São Domingos in the north, that of Bissau and Bolama in the center and that of Bafatá and Geba in the east. The variety spoken in Cacheu and São Domingos seems to be the most conservative, maintaining structural features today found in the variety spoken in Casamance in Senegal (which lost contact with the superstrate in the nineteenth century; Casamancese Creole is treated as a separate <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span> language).  The variety of Bissau and Bolama is the most progressive (having remained in contact with the superstrate as well as its substrate languages). Guinea-Bissau Kriyol was essentially an oral language but written texts gradually began to appear as vehicles of literature, science and religion. It is used in news programs on radio and television, in business, in daily life, and in churches and mosques.

34,Casamancese Creole,,12.7,-16.274,uppe1455,,"Casamancese Creole is the mother tongue of about 10,000 people living in or around the Senegalese city of Ziguinchor (Basse-Casamance, Southern Senegal). It is also spoken with various degrees of proficiency by several tens of thousands of second language speakers living in the same region. The language seems to be quite homogeneous. However, language variation exists and seems to be linked with several factors. First, there is a contrast between urban Casamancese (spoken in Ziguinchor), more exposed to the influence of Wolof, French and Guinea-Bissau Kriyol vs. rural Casamancese, generally more conservative and also more influenced by several local adstrates (mostly Ñun, Joola, and Mandinka). Second, there are differences between native and non-native varieties of Casamancese Creole. In the Casamancese-speaking sections of Ziguinchor and in some neighbouring villages (e.g. Sindone), Casamancese is spoken by many people as a first language whereas in other villages (e.g. Djifanghor), Casamancese is used on a daily basis but as a second language alongside with a native language (e.g. a local variety of Ñun in Djifanghor). As regards Djifanghor (and this surely applies to other bilingual communities), the Casamancese spoken by Ñun-speakers, although being very similar to native Casamancese, displays some idiosyncratic developments, e.g. it allows analogical synthetic causatives for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">mas</span> ‘more’ &gt; <span style=""font-style: italic;"">masintí</span> ‘surpass, have a bigger share than’ or <span style=""font-style: italic;"">bas</span> ‘underneath’ &gt; <span style=""font-style: italic;"">basintí</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>‘surpass, be better than’, which are refused by native Casamancese speakers. Third, together with urban vs. rural and first vs. second language, there also exists diatopic variation (e.g. the word for ‘cloud’ is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">nuybu</span> in some villages and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">nirbu/nírbu/nibu</span> in other places). Unless otherwise specified, the default lect illustrated in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS </span>is the variety of Casamancese Creole spoken in the village of Sindone (some 30 km East of Ziguinchor). This rural variety is the native lect of Noël Bernard Biagui, who co-authored this contribution and it is today the main vernacular (and also the first vehicular) language in Sindone.

35,Santome,,0.33285,6.88,saot1239,cri,"Santome is a Portuguese-related creole language spoken primarily on the island of S. Tomé in the Democratic Republic of S. Tomé e Príncipe by some 60.000 people (2012), which corresponds roughly to one third of its population, and by an unknown number of speakers in the diaspora (e.g. Portugal and Angola). Compared to previous censuses (1991, 2001), the number of speakers appears to be dropping quickly, which is related to the ongoing shift to Portuguese, the official language. In fact, monolingual speakers of Santome are nowadays hard to find. As a non-official language, Santome is essentially an informally used spoken language that is growingly confined from a geographical, generational and functional perspective, which means it is more likely to find fluent speakers in non-urban settings and among older generations. Music is the one of the few domains where the language is still thriving.

It is a maroon creole, that is, a creole that was spoken by slaves who escaped from slavery and rebuilt their own society in regions where they were free from the slave owners. Some Angolar speakers also live on Principe Island as well as in Portugal, especially in Lisbon.

It is not clear whether the language is still being passed on to the newer generations; the pressure from Santome, the other creole language spoken on the island, and from Portuguese is very strong.

Though Angolar is not mutually intelligible with Santome, it is closely related to and most probably derived from it (as the other two creole languages of the Gulf of Guinea, Principense and Fa d’Ambô). What characterizes Angolar is that an important part of its vocabulary is of Bantu, especially of Kimbundu origin.

The dominant languages of Principe are regional varieties of Portuguese as well as Cape Verdean Creole; the latter is spoken by more than half of the population of the island, due to the important immigration of Cape Verdeans from the beginning of the 20th century.

Some efforts have been made to teach Principense in school, but these efforts have not been successful. Printed media do not exist on the island of Principe, but radio news are broadcast five times a week (sometimes less).

Although they ultimately have their origin in the contact varieties that emerged on the plantation of Suriname, they developed into distinct varieties, having undergone separate development after their founders’ settlement in the interior of the Surinamese/French Guianese rainforst. There has always been some contact between Maroons and the coastal population through Maroon men’s commercial activities and seasonal cash labor. However, contact has gradually intensified since the 1950s with Maroons’ greater integration into Surinamese and recently also French Guianese society due to both migration and, to a much lesser extent, social change in the village setting. Today, both many Maroon men and women live in or regularly spend time in urban contexts and are in contact with members of other Maroon communities and non-Maroons. In this new context, code alternation practices involving the regional lingua franca Sranan (also Sranantongo), but also other languages such as Dutch and to a lesser extent French and English have become quite frequent in both out-group and in-group speech among younger people and new social varieties (e.g. wakaman/yunkuman tongo) have emerged besides other existing ones such as respect speech (cf.

Since the Portuguese never occupied Batavia, this creole must have been brought to Batavia from outside. Strong structural similarities point to Papiá Kristang spoken in Malacca as its source, but the language has also been influenced by southern Indo-Portuguese varieties.

Although speakers insist that there are significant differences between the varieties of Aruba and Curaçao, work on these varieties has only established minor differences. Similar claims have been made by urban Curaçaoan speakers about more rural varieties, but there is really no evidence to suggest that mutual intelligibility is in any way compromised.
Where there is a significant difference is in the spelling conventions adopted in the different islands: where Aruba opted to use an etymological spelling method, Curaçao and Bonaire adopted the phonemic system developed by the late Raul Römer. As a result, texts produced in the different islands are visually very different and easily give an impression of unintelligibility. In this description of Papiamentu, the orthography of examples has been normalized to Römer’s phonemic spelling system regardless of their original spelling.

48,Palenquero,,10.10318,-75.198807,pale1260,pln,"Palenquero (“Lengua”) is used actively on a daily basis only in the village of Palenque (also known as San Basilio de Palenque), where it co-exists with Caribbean Spanish. Prior to its recent revival (around the year 2000), the creole was generally shunned by younger generations. Occasionally, Palenquero can also be heard in the nearby city of Cartagena, and the more distant Barranquilla, where about half of the total population of Palenqueros have been residing for many decades. To date, Palenquero remains a mostly oral language. Written Palenquero (used locally in school) has emerged during this millennium; agreed upon spelling conventions do not exist yet.

Traditionally, Palenquero tended to be confined to in-group situations, so much so that the language was generally not spoken in front of outsiders. Around the year 2000, changing local and regional attitudes began to reduce the heavy stigma once attached to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lengua, </span>and as a result Palenqueros now feel far more comfortable speaking their local lect in front of outsiders (the recent fame of Palenque has generated a substantial amount of local academic tourism —both national and international—, which has greatly increased contact with the outside world).

As argued in Schwegler (2001), prior to the year 2000, in Palenque there used to be no apparent lectal differences (basilect, mesolect or acrolect). In this small speech community, old and young bilinguals employed a virtually identical creole grammar, that is, there was no continuum, no “in-between” in terms of lects. This situation appears to have changed since then, as some of the younger generations may be employing a somewhat restructured variety of the creole as their main lect. However, to date no extensive study of current Palenquero has been undertaken (but see Lipski 2012), and it remains to be seen whether the recent adaptations by Palenquero youths will stabilize and have a long-lasting effect.

49,Haitian Creole,,19,-72.5,hait1244,hat,"Haitian Creole is a French-based creole spoken by about 9.5 million people in Haiti. It is the creole language with the largest number of speakers worldwide. While all Haitians speak Creole, only a minority of the population (about 7%) are bilingual and also speak French. It is difficult to estimate the precise number of speakers among Haitians living in diaspora communities, i.e. the about 2 million people that emigrated mainly to the USA, Canada (Québec), Dominican Republic and French Overseas territories (Lesser Antilles, Guiana). 

The Haitian Constitution of 1987 granted Haitian Creole the status of an official language next to French (official language since 1918). The language of the schools had long been exclusively in French, but opened up to Creole from 1979 onwards. In that year an official phonologically based orthography was implemented for Haitian Creole. In the following the Creole was used in an increasing number of domains and in the mass media (especially radio and internet).	

The Creole of rural monolinguals that is used all over Haiti was documented in a linguistic atlas (Fattier 1998). The global description of each variety allows us to distinguish the forms that are specific to each variety from those that are common to all dialects. It is the forms that are “common to all dialects” that represent the default lect described in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span>.

However, her lect has stayed traditional as she left the place in 1999 and during her visits in 2003 and 2006, she noticed that there had been developments and structural changes.

58,Kikongo-Kituba,,-4.565474,17.666016,kitu1246,ktu,"Kikongo-Kituba is spoken by over 10 million people in the provinces of Bas-Congo and Bandundu in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and in the southern part of the Republic of Congo. Whether or not it is regarded as a creole depends on whether or not one associates creoles exclusively with European lexifiers in plantation settlement colonies. It was lexified by Kimanyanga, one of the languages in the Kikongo cluster. It dates from the late 19th or early 20th century, after the Belgian colonial administration of the then Congo Free State imported laborers speaking diverse Bantu languages from various parts of central Africa to build the railroad between the Atlantic coast and the capital city, Kinshasa (then called Léopoldville). It has also been associated with the colonial auxiliaries brought from West Africa by the Belgian administrators to serve as intermediaries and interpreters. Both the laborers and auxiliaries adopted Kimanyanga, which had served as a trade lingua franca from the Atlantic coast to the interior, for communication with the locals and among themselves, while they lived segregated from both the Europeans and the locals. The particular settings in which these populations were brought to co-exist were designated as ""centres extra-coutumiers"" ‘non-traditional centers’, the ancestors of present-day cities, associated with modern economic activities. As the colonial administration expanded into the interior, beyond the lower Congo River area, the restructured Kimanyanga spread with it. Functioning at first as a lingua franca, it evolved into an urban vernacular. Bearing influence from the various Bantu languages it came in contact with, it speciated into a new language. From these new urban centers, it spread as a regional lingua franca. Regarding regional variation, which does not impede mutual intelligibility, see Mufwene (1997).

59,Sango,,5,18,sang1328,sag,"Sango is the national language of the Central African Republic and co-official with French. It is certainly the vernacular (the most common language of every-day use) of Bangui, the nation’s capital, with more than half a million inhabitants. In 1994 69 per cent of pre-school children of different ethnicities spoke only Sango; among school children 10 to 16 years of age 31 per cent were similarly Sangophone. For Protestant adults, the figure was 26 per cent. Sango is probably spoken by most of Central African Republic’s indigenous population out of a total number of three to four million. The number of people not competent in Sango has probably increased in recent years as people fled social and political upheavals in neighbouring Chad and Sudan, the most recent one being the Islamist invasion and conquest in April 2013. As a vernacular, it is more important than French, which is the written language, even in popular political discourse. Sango literature is entirely religious. Though there are radio broadcasts in Sango, much of them extemporaneous translations of French texts, this must be considered a separate lect because of its extreme francification. The <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">default lect</span> used for this project is characteristic of young inhabitants in Bangui in the 1990s as found in tape recordings of extemporaneous speech. Another lect, which I call <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">written</span>, is extemporaneous speech with a
great deal of French. This lect is also used in the Sango of personal letters and in publications of religious literature.Plans three decades ago for the standardization of Sango and its implementation in the educational system came to nought very quickly. For the future, the most certain prediction is that Sango will continue to change under the influence of ‘broken French.’

</span>The persons to whom I am indebted for having been able to study Sango from a scholarly point of view are too numerous to name in their entirety, but special note must be given to Louise (deceased) and Antoine Depeyre for their hospitality in France and Jeannine Gerbault for her various kinds of help in Bangui. Among the institutions that provided research grants are these: the United States Department of Education, the International Studies Program of the University of Toronto, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Canada Council, the University of Toronto, and Centre national de la Recherche scientifique (CNRS) of France. The Congrégation du Saint-Esprit provided hospitality in Paris and enabled me to consult the archives of its mission in Oubangui-Chari/Central African Republic. The International Grace Brethren Missions (USA) (known as Mission Evangélique des Frères in the Central African Republic) also provided housing and a vehicle. The Ministry of Education of the Central African Republic opened its country to me to travel and conduct research, and Célestin Kanzi-Soussou and Lamine Ndocko transcribed some of the tape recordings.

60,Lingala,,-1.675176,16.671753,ling1263,lin,"Lingala has its origins in a process of pidginization that took place in the early 1880s involving the Central African language Bobangi as main lexifier. In 1884, the resulting pidgin was taken to the colonial state post Bangala Station (today, Mankanza), where it underwent expanding influence from the local languages and where it received its first glossonym, “Bangala”. From the late 1880s onwards, the language spread from the station in north-eastward direction, as far as the Sudanese border, and in southward direction, as far as Léopoldville (now, Kinshasa). In each place, influence from local languages further expanded the language along independent trajectories. On top of this, in the first decade of the 20th century, missionaries working in the Bangala Station area (then renamed Nouvelle-Anvers) embarked on a vast project of prescriptive corpus planning, also suggesting the new glossonym “Lingala”. The engineered variant gained ground in the north-western region of the Belgian Congo, where the language as spoken today still very much resembles the way the missionaries designed it to be. But in Léopoldville its functions were restricted to church and school contexts, while for routine communication Bangala remained in use, following its own path of linguistic development (particularly marked by influence from Kikongo) and, in the first half of the 20th century, spilling over to Brazzaville. The new language name was more successful, soon receiving acceptance in Léopoldville, too. But in the north-eastern parts of the Congo, the old glossonym Bangala survived and, in fact, continues to be used until today. Since the late colonial and post-colonial eras, the variety spoken in the politically important and culturally vanguard capital Léopoldville -Kinshasa has been the most influential and popular one, encroaching on the varieties spoken in the north-west of the DR Congo, in the north-east, and in Brazzaville.

64,Juba Arabic,,4.266667,31.016666,suda1237,pga,"Juba Arabic is an Arabic-based pidgincreole spoken in the Republic of South Sudan. At present, Juba Arabic is the major lingua franca of South Sudan as well as of large diaspora communities in Sudan, Egypt, the United States, and Australia. As Juba Arabic has many second- and third-language speakers, it is difficult to estimate the number of its speakers. Since 2005, Juba Arabic has been recognized as ""national language"", whereas English is the only ""official language"" of South Sudan. While it does not possess an established standard orthography, Juba Arabic is widely written in the Latin script. 

It is doubtful whether we can speak of a continuum in the case of Juba Arabic and its Sudanese Arabic lexifier. The prolonged coexistence of Juba Arabic with Sudanese Arabic has resulted in increasing structural affinity between this pidgincreole and its lexifier (labeled as ""<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Arabic interference</span>"" in the data set). The structural effects of this contact situation vary a great deal according to sociolinguistic variables such as the speakers' residence and their degree of education.

Although the language has had a long history of writing, writing was mainly done in the past by professional writers, especially in the field of literature. The internet and social media have drastically increased the number of ordinary persons who are now writing Jamaican. There is an official writing system (Cassidy-JLU orthography) for the language, but it is mostly used by linguists and a few other language enthusiasts. The ordinary folk continue to use an English etymological style to represent the language in writing. There is some local programming on radio and television in Jamaican and many advertisements across various media make extensive use of Jamaican. The language has several descriptions of its syntax and phonology (e.g. Bailey 1966, Akers (1981), Patrick 2007, Durrleman-Tame 2008), a dictionary (Cassidy &amp; Le Page 1967/1980) and a recent translation of the New Testament done by the Bible Society of the West Indies (2012).

Basilectal Jamaican is characterized by the categorical use of preverbal markers to express tense, mood, and aspect. Since most of the examples reflect my (Joseph T.

The distinguishing features of this variety is the use of wehn as anterior marker where eastern varieties use en, or min (highly restricted), and the use of de as progressive aspect marker where  non-western dialects use a. It is assumed that most of the features of the western basilectal variety of Jamaican captured in APiCS Online are the same as or very close to basilectal varieties islandwide. Mesolectal Jamaican, the only other lect identified in the APiCS database is characterized by the use of preverbal did as anterior marker, the suffix -in to mark progressive aspect, and the variable occurrence of the -s suffix to mark plural, sometimes along with the prototypical basilectal marker dem (e.g. di gorlz [dem] 'the girls').",farquharsonjosepht,farquharsonjosepht,"Jamaican.
