This is the third volume of the three-volume <i>Survey of Pidgin and
Creole Languages</i>, the first collection of expert-authored
overview articles on the world’s most important pidgins, creoles,
and other mixed languages. This volume deals with seven languages
based on African languages, seven languages based on Asian and
Pacific languages, one language based on an Australian language, and
four languages based on languages of the Americas. The other two
volumes cover Germanic-based languages and Romance-based languages.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
The <i>Survey</i> <i>of Pidgin and Creole Languages</i> results from
a collaborative effort between 2006 and 2011 of over 90 specialists
from around the world, which resulted in both the <i>Atlas of Pidgin
and Creole Language Structures</i> (<i>APiCS</i>, published as a
single volume, with an accompanying online database) and in this
<i>Survey</i>.<font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"> </font> Since
the <i>Atlas</i> is the most innovative aspect of the collaborative
effort, the entire enterprise that gave rise to this joint
publication has also been known as the “<i>APiCS</i> project”.
<span lang="fr-CH">The idea for the </span><span lang="fr-CH"><i>APiCS</i></span><span lang="fr-CH">
project arose at a meeting of the </span><span lang="fr-CH"><i>Groupe
Européen de Recherches en Langues Creoles</i></span><span lang="fr-CH">
in 2005. </span>The <i>Atlas</i> was inspired by the <i>World Atlas
of Language Structures</i> (Haspelmath, Dryer, Gil and Comrie 2005).
A little later the editors decided to add <span lang="fr-CH">a </span><span lang="fr-CH"><i>Survey</i></span><span lang="fr-CH">
part to the project.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
As part of their collaboration in the <i>APiCS</i> project, the
experts filled in the <i>APiCS</i> questionnaire, which is the basis
of the <i>APiCS</i> online database and the maps in the <i>Atlas</i>
volume, and in addition wrote a survey chapter on their language,
published in one of the three <i>Survey</i> volumes. Thus, each
author (or author team) has two publications within the project: A
book chapter and an online dataset.<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>
Some authors have served as experts for two or more languages.
Between 2006 and 2010, five workshops and two bigger conferences took
place in Leipzig, where not only the form of the database
contributions, but also the surveys were discussed. Almost all the
contributors were given a chance to attend one of these conferences,
or at least one of the <i>APiCS</i> events at conferences (SPCL
Anaheim and SPCL Amsterdam in 2007, SPCL Cayenne in 2008, SPCL San
Francisco in 2009, Giessen Creolistics Workshop in 2009, SPCL Cologne
in 2009, SPCL Accra in 2011).

Like the <i>Atlas</i>, the <i>Survey</i> has no precedent in the
field. Holm (1988) offers a single-authored general overview of
pidgins and creoles, covering both the most important languages and
the most important grammatical features. Kouwenberg &amp; Singler
(2008) is a collection of general chapters on various topics and
issues by different authors. The <i>Survey of Pidgin and Creole
Languages</i>, by contrast, is the first work to provide
authoritative, standardized and thus comparable overview chapters on
the sociolinguistics and the grammar of each language, all written by
experts with extensive first-hand experience on the language.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Each chapter contains an infobox and a map showing the location of
the language,<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>
sections on the social history, the sociolinguistic situation, the
phonology, the pronouns and the noun phrase, the structure of the
verb and verbal markers, and the syntax of simple clauses and of
complex sentences. Each chapter is followed by a short glossed and
translated text. For many of these texts a sound file is freely
available on <i>APiCS Online</i> (http://apics-online.org). Finally,
each chapter is concluded by a bibliography which lists all the major
scholarly works on the language. Apart from this general structure,
which is uniform across all 74 chapters, the authors had freedom to
emphasize those aspects of the language that they felt were most
interesting. Overall, the chapters are very homogenous, and readers
will find it easy to compare the different languages by means of the
<i>Survey</i> contributions.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Inevitably, the choice of languages for such an enterprise will be
partially opportunistic and potentially controversial. For some
little-studied languages that we would have liked to include, we did
not find any authors that could have contributed a chapter. In
choosing languages and in choosing category names for different kinds
of languages, we were confronted with the problem that while there is
a vibrant field of pidgin and creole language studies, there are no
commonly agreed criteria by which the category of creoles and pidgins
can be readily delimited. All experts in this field agree that
pidgins and creoles are new languages that are distinct from the
languages from which they took the bulk of their lexicon or their
grammar, and not just “corrupted” or “broken” versions of
their lexifiers (lexicon-providing languages). We know that all of
them arose as a result of an unusually high degree of language
contact influence in special social circumstances such as
long-distance trade and forced or indentured labour. Sometimes these
languages have therefore simply been called “contact languages”
in recent years (cf. Holm &amp; Michaelis (eds.) 2008). But the term
&quot;contact language&quot; has also been used in a much broader
sense, and since our focus was on the languages that are
traditionally discussed under the heading of &quot;pidgin&quot; and
&quot;creole&quot;, this term was not suitable for our project.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Our choice of the term “pidgin and creole languages” thus simply
follows traditional ordinary usage in the field, and should not be
taken to imply a particular definition of “pidgin” or “creole”.
Our main goal with this work (the <i>Atlas</i> and the <i>Survey</i>)
has been to provide a new systematic and solid factual basis on which
future work can build, not to engage in theoretical or ideological
debates.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Languages which underwent an unusually high degree of contact are not
only those languages widely known as pidgins and creoles, but also
include languages which are more often discussed under the rubric of
“mixed languages” (cf. Matras &amp; Bakker 2003), of which there
are various types (e.g. “bilingual mixed languages”, “intertwined
languages”). The debate on the nature and origin of all these
varieties is still going on, so we decided to include a number of
these languages in both the <i>Atlas</i> and the <i>Survey</i>.
Typical cases of languages which are regarded as mixed languages that
are not pidgins or creoles are Michif, Media Lengua, Gurindji Kriol
and Mixed Ma’a/Mbugu. Moreover, we also included languages with a
history of high contact that are sometimes called “semi-creoles”
(Holm 2004) and languages that are in other ways similar or related
to pidgins or creoles, such as African American English, Afrikaans,
and Sri Lankan Malay. Thus, our general approach was to be inclusive
rather than exclusive. If a language is not included here that meets
all the above criteria (and no doubt there are many such languages),
this is for practical reasons, not for any principled reasons. We are
aware that we were not able to fulfil everybody’s wishes, but we
are confident that our selection of languages can be seen as
representative of the kinds of languages that contact linguists have
focused their research on over the last few decades. Readers who wish
to classify our languages according to their criteria into groups are
invited to do so on the basis of the sociohistorical and structural
information provided in the individual survey chapters.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
To help the reader’s orientation, we have classified our languages
into English-based, Dutch-based, Portuguese-based, and so on. Again,
this classification is not entirely uncontroversial. On the one hand,
contact languages are characterized by strong influence from multiple
languages, so saying, for instance, that Haitian Creole is
French-based is problematic, as it glosses over the very important
contribution of the African languages, especially to the grammar of
the language. For this reason, many authors have used expressions
like “French-lexified”, “Dutch-lexified” for such languages,
which only refer to the role of the European languages as primary
lexicon-providers.<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a></sup>
We agree that such terms are more precise, but they are also more
cumbersome, so we have used the older (and still much more
widespread) manner of classifying creoles and pidgins. We think that
it is sufficiently well-known that “English-based” (etc.) is not
meant to imply anything other than that the bulk of the language’s
lexicon is derived from English.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
On the other hand, the notion of being based on a language is
problematic in the case of mixed languages. We have (somewhat
arbitrarily) decided to put these languages in the category of
non-European-based languages whenever one of the base languages is
non-European (so Michif and Media Lengua are not Romance-based
languages, and Gurindji Kriol is not an English-based language, for
the purposes of the arrangement in the <i>Survey</i>). There are also
a few other cases where it is not fully clear what the primary
lexifier is. Saramaccan’s vocabulary has a very large Portuguese
component, but for simplicity we classify it as English-based here.
Papiamentu is often thought to be originally (Afro-)Portuguese-based,
but as it has long been influenced much more by Spanish, we classify
it as Spanish-based.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-indent: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
We made no attempt to use a uniform system for the language names, so
the Survey contains chapters on “Bahamian Creole”, “Nicaraguan
Creole English” and “Trinidad English Creole” side by side. We
used the names that the authors preferred, and that they think are
the most widely used, by scholars and/or by the speakers themselves.
Since there is no agreement on what exactly a pidgin and a creole is,
it was impossible to try to use these terms systematically in the
language names. Moreover, quite a few of the languages have
well-established names that do not contain the elements “pidgin”
or “creole” at all (Bislama, Krio, Tayo, Papiamentu, etc.). Note
that when we refer to creole or pidgin languages in general, we never
capitalize these terms. They are only capitalized as part of language
names, and sometimes when “Pidgin” or “Creole” are used as
abbreviations of a longer language name (as when “Creole” is used
to refer to Seychelles Creole, in a context where it is clear that
the creole of the Seychelles is referred to).</p>
