<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><span>This is the second volume of the three-volume <i>Survey of Pidgin and Creole Languages</i>,
the first collection of expert-authored overview articles on the world’s most
important pidgins, creoles and other mixed languages. This volume deals with 14
Portuguese-based languages, five Spanish-based languages, and eight
French-based languages. The other two volumes cover English- and Dutch-based
languages and languages based on non-European languages.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>The <i>Survey</i> <i>of Pidgin and Creole Languages</i> is the
outcome of a collaborative effort between 2006 and 2011 of over 90 specialists
from around the world, which resulted in both the <i>Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures</i> (<i>APiCS</i>, published as a single volume,
with an accompanying online database) and in this <i>Survey</i>.</span><span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%"> </span></span><span><span> </span>Since the <i>Atlas</i> is the most innovative aspect of the collaborative effort,
the entire enterprise that gave rise to this joint publication has also been
known as the “<i>APiCS</i> project”. </span><span>The idea for the <i>APiCS</i> project arose at a meeting of the <i>Groupe Européen de Recherches en Langues
Creoles</i> in 2005. </span><span>The <i>Atlas</i> was inspired by the <i>World
Atlas of Language Structures</i> (Haspelmath, Dryer, Gil and Comrie 2005). A
little later the editors decided to add </span><span>a <i>Survey</i>
part to the project.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>As part of their collaboration in the <i>APiCS</i> project, the experts filled in the <i>APiCS</i> questionnaire, which is the basis of the <i>APiCS</i> online database and the maps in the <i>Atlas</i> volume, and in addition wrote a survey chapter on their
language, published in one of the three <i>Survey</i>
volumes. Thus, each author (or author team) has two publications within the
project: A book chapter and an online dataset.<a class="popover-note" data-content='&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:150%"&gt;In a few cases, the survey chapter author team is not exactly identical to the database team, but mostly the same experts provided both the dataset and the survey chapter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' data-original-title="Note 1" style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;"><sup>1</sup></a> Some authors have served as experts for two or more languages.
Between 2006 and 2010, five workshops and two bigger conferences took place in
Leipzig, where not only the form of the database contributions, but also the
surveys were discussed. Almost all the contributors were given a chance to
attend one of these conferences, or at least one of the <i>APiCS</i> events at conferences (SPCL Anaheim and SPCL Amsterdam in
2007, SPCL Cayenne in 2008, SPCL San Francisco in 2009, Giessen Creolistics
Workshop in 2009, SPCL Cologne in 2009, SPCL Accra in 2011). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>Like the <i>Atlas</i>, the <i>Survey</i> has no precedent in the field.
<a class="ref-link" data-content="holm1988" style="cursor: pointer;">Holm (1988</a>) offers a single-authored general overview of pidgins and creoles,
covering both the most important languages and the most important grammatical
features. <a class="ref-link" data-content="kouwenbergsingler2008" style="cursor: pointer;">Kouwenberg &amp; Singler (2008</a>) is a collection of general chapters
on various topics and issues by different authors. The <i>Survey of Pidgin and Creole Languages</i>, by contrast, is the first
work to provide authoritative, standardized and thus comparable overview
chapters on the sociolinguistics and the grammar of each language, all written
by experts with extensive first-hand experience on the language.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>Each chapter contains an infobox and a map showing the location of
the language,<a class="popover-note" data-content='&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:150%"&gt;The political boundaries shown on these maps, as well as any other statements on political entities throughout these volumes, are exclusively intended to help the reader’s general orientation. We take no stance on any controversial political issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' data-original-title="Note 2" style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;"><sup>2</sup></a> sections on the social history, the sociolinguistic situation, the
phonology, the pronouns and the noun phrase, the structure of the verb and
verbal markers, and the syntax of simple clauses and of complex sentences. Each
chapter is followed by a short glossed and translated text. For many of these
texts a sound file is freely available on <i>APiCS
Online</i> (http://apics-online.info). Finally, each chapter is concluded by a
bibliography which lists all the major scholarly works on the language. Apart
from this general structure, which is uniform across all 74 chapters, the
authors had freedom to emphasize those aspects of the language that they felt
were most interesting. Overall, the chapters are very homogenous, and readers
will find it easy to compare the different languages by means of the <i>Survey</i> contributions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>Inevitably, the choice of languages for such an enterprise will be
partially opportunistic and potentially controversial. For some little-studied
languages that we would have liked to include, we did not find any authors that
could have contributed a chapter. In choosing languages and in choosing
category names for different kinds of languages, we were confronted with the
problem that while there is a vibrant field of pidgin and creole language
studies, there are no commonly agreed criteria by which the category of creoles
and pidgins can be readily delimited. All experts in this field agree that
pidgins and creoles are new languages that are distinct from the languages from
which they took the bulk of their lexicon or their grammar, and not just
“corrupted” or “broken” versions of their lexifiers (lexicon-providing
languages). We know that all of them arose as a result of an unusually high
degree of language contact influence in special social circumstances such as
long-distance trade and forced or indentured labour. Sometimes these languages
have therefore simply been called “contact languages” in recent years (cf. Holm
&amp; Michaelis (eds.) 2008). But the term "contact language" has
also been used in a much broader sense, and since our focus was on the
languages that are traditionally discussed under the heading of
"pidgin" and "creole", this term was not suitable for our
project.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>Our choice of the term “pidgin and creole languages” thus simply
follows traditional ordinary usage in the field, and should not be taken to
imply a particular definition of “pidgin” or “creole”. Our main goal with this
work (the <i>Atlas</i> and the <i>Survey</i>) has been to provide a new
systematic and solid factual basis on which future work can build, not to
engage in theoretical or ideological debates.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>Languages which underwent an unusually high degree of contact are
not only those languages widely known as pidgins and creoles, but also include
languages which are more often discussed under the rubric of “mixed languages”
(cf. <a class="ref-link" data-content="matrasbakker2003" style="cursor: pointer;">Matras &amp; Bakker 2003</a>), of which there are various types (e.g.
“bilingual mixed languages”, “intertwined languages”). The debate on the nature
and origin of all these varieties is still going on, so we decided to include a
number of these languages in both the <i>Atlas</i>
and the <i>Survey</i>. Typical cases of
languages which are regarded as mixed languages that are not pidgins or creoles
are <a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a>, <a href="/contributions/73">Media Lengua</a>, <a href="/contributions/72">Gurindji Kriol</a> and <a href="/contributions/62">Mixed Ma’a/Mbugu</a>. Moreover, we
also included languages with a history of high contact that are sometimes
called “semi-creoles” (<a class="ref-link" data-content="holm2004" style="cursor: pointer;">Holm 2004</a>) and languages that are in other ways similar
or related to pidgins or creoles, such as <a href="/contributions/14">African American English</a>, <a href="/contributions/29">Afrikaans</a>,
and <a href="/contributions/66">Sri Lankan Malay</a>. Thus, our general approach was to be inclusive rather
than exclusive. If a language is not included here that meets all the above
criteria (and no doubt there are many such languages), this is for practical
reasons, not for any principled reasons. We are aware that we were not able to
fulfil everybody’s wishes, but we are confident that our selection of languages
can be seen as representative of the kinds of languages that contact linguists
have focused their research on over the last few decades. Readers who wish to
classify our languages according to their criteria into groups are invited to
do so on the basis of the sociohistorical and structural information provided
in the individual survey chapters.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>To help the reader’s orientation, we have classified our languages
into English-based, Dutch-based, Portuguese-based, and so on. Again, this
classification is not entirely uncontroversial. On the one hand, contact
languages are characterized by strong influence from multiple languages, so
saying, for instance, that <a href="/contributions/49">Haitian Creole</a> is French-based is problematic, as it
glosses over the very important contribution of the African languages,
especially to the grammar of the language. For this reason, many authors have
used expressions like “French-lexified”, “Dutch-lexified” for such languages,
which only refer to the role of the European languages as primary
lexicon-providers.<a class="popover-note" data-content='&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:150%"&gt;Still other authors have used expressions like “English-related”, “French-related“, which make the role of the lexifier languages appear less central.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' data-original-title="Note 3" style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;"><sup>3</sup></a> We agree
that such terms are more precise, but they are also more cumbersome, so we have
used the older (and still much more widespread) manner of classifying creoles
and pidgins. We think that it is sufficiently well-known that “English-based”
(etc.) is not meant to imply anything other than that the bulk of the
language’s lexicon is derived from English.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>On the other hand, the notion of being based on a language is
problematic in the case of mixed languages. We have (somewhat arbitrarily)
decided to put these languages in the category of non-European-based languages
whenever one of the base languages is non-European (so <a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a> and <a href="/contributions/73">Media Lengua</a>
are not Romance-based languages, and <a href="/contributions/72">Gurindji Kriol</a> is not an English-based
language, for the purposes of the arrangement in the <i>Survey</i>). There are also a few other cases where it is not fully
clear what the primary lexifier is. <a href="/contributions/3">Saramaccan</a>’s vocabulary has a very large
Portuguese component, but for simplicity we classify it as English-based here.
<a href="/contributions/47">Papiamentu</a> is often thought to be originally (Afro-)Portuguese-based, but as it
has long been influenced much more by Spanish, we classify it as Spanish-based.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:150%"><span>We made no attempt to use a uniform system for the language names,
so the <i>Survey</i> contains chapters on
<a href="/contributions/49">Haitian Creole</a>, <a href="/contributions/52">Guyanais</a>, <a href="/contributions/39">Diu Indo-Portuguese</a>, and <a href="/contributions/40">Korlai</a> side by side. We used
the names that the authors preferred, and that they think are the most widely
used, by scholars and/or by the speakers themselves. Since there is no
agreement on what exactly a pidgin and a creole is, it was impossible to try to
use these terms systematically in the language names. Moreover, quite a few of
the languages have well-established names that do not contain the elements
“pidgin” or “creole” at all (<a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a>, <a href="/contributions/35">Santome</a>, <a href="/contributions/57">Tayo</a>, <a href="/contributions/47">Papiamentu</a>, etc.). Note
that when we refer to creole or pidgin languages in general, we never
capitalize these terms. They are only capitalized as part of language names,
and sometimes when “Pidgin” or “Creole” are used as abbreviations of a longer
language name (as when “Creole” is used to refer to <a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a>, in a
context where it is clear that the creole of the Seychelles is referred to).</span></p>
