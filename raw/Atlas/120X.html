<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1basics" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h4><p class="c9">Distinctions between
the vowel systems and the consonant systems of the <i>APiCS</i>
languages were treated in a different way from the morphosyntactic
and lexical features in our questionnaire. While we had no choice
but to make a specific selection of 120 morphosyntactic and lexical
features, because there is an indefinitely large number of them,
the segment inventories of languages are relatively small, allowing
us to ask the contributors to supply all of them.</p><p class="c9">Thus, our questionnaire
for the segment features consisted of another 93 features, i.e. the
segment types that are the most frequent in the world’s languages
(according to Maddieson 1984). If a language had segments that do
not fall into any of these 93 types, the contributors were asked to
add a new segment type. In the end, we had 177 different segment
features. The segment features were filled in using a database
layout in the form of the IPA chart (Figure 3).</p><p class="c9">The values were quite
uniform:</p><p class="c9">1. Exists (as a major
allophone)</p><p class="c9">2. Exists only as a
minor allophone</p><p class="c9">3. Exists only in
loanwords</p><p class="c9">4. Does not exist</p><p class="c9">In addition, the
contributors were asked to provide an example word with gloss and
were allowed to include a comment.</p><p class="c9">The information that we
have on segments is thus very rich, but it would of course be too
much to show another 183 world maps, one for each segment type.
Thus, we have selected ten segment features (Chapters 121-130)
which are particularly interesting because they show interesting
variation across the <i>APiCS</i> languages. In <i>APiCS
Online</i>, the complete information on all the segment features is
given.</p><p class="c7">2. Segments vs.
phonemes, major allophones and minor allophones</p><p class="c9">In descriptive
grammars, the segment inventories (i.e. inventories of consonants
and vowels) are usually described as “phoneme inventories”. We
avoid the term “phoneme” here, because a classification of segments
into phonemes requires an abstract analysis, and analyses may
differ significantly depending on the assumptions. Phonemes may
subsume allophones with rather different phonetic properties, so
comparing phonemes across languages is difficult. Phonemes are
descriptive categories, but for our purposes we just need segment
types as comparative concepts (<a class="ref-link" data-content="haspelmath2010" style="cursor: pointer;">Haspelmath 2010</a>). Thus, we left
aside phoneme status and just asked our contributors about the
segments that are found in their language. We wanted to know
whether they exist as major allophones, as minor allophones, or
only in loanwords.</p><p class="c13"><span class="c12"><span class="c10">By</span> <span class="c11">major allophone</span><span class="c10">, we mean an allophone (i.e. a phonetic
realization) that occurs in about half the tokens of a phoneme or
more often, while a minor allophone is an allophone that occurs in
less than half of the tokens. For example, in <a href="/contributions/37">Principense</a>, the
phoneme /s/ has two allophones: [ʃ] (before a high front vowel) and
[s] (elsewhere). Thus, [s] is a major allophone, and [ʃ] is a minor
allophone (cf. Chapter 125).</span></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c14">Our
definition of major and minor allophone allows for a situation
where a phoneme has two major allophones (namely when there are
exactly two allophones, and they both occur equally frequently). It
also allows for a situation in which a phoneme has no major
allophones, e.g. when it has five allophones, each of which occurs
about one fifth of the time. Note that we did not ask the
contributors to specify which phoneme a segment belongs
to.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c12"><span class="c10">In practice, our contributors seem to have chosen
“minor allophone” also in situations where the segment in question
does not occur in complementary distribution with another segment
and thus would strictly speaking qualify as a contrastive segment
(a phoneme), but where the segment occurs under quite restricted
circumstances. Thus, “exists as a major allophone” can also be
interpreted as “exists in a prominent way” and “exists as a minor
allophone” as “exists in a limited way”. We did not make a serious
attempt to distinguish the various subtypes of prominent and
limited existence, as the major focus of the</span> <span class="c15">APiCS</span> <span class="c10">questionnaire was on the 120
morphosyntactic features.</span></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c16">One
frequent issue for phoneme systems is the extent to which
diphthongs, long vowels and geminate consonants are included. We
did not provide specific guidelines for these special cases, and as
a result, our database is probably less than fully consistent with
respect to these kinds of segments.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="section-3distributionofsegmentfeatures"><span class="c17">3.
Distribution of segment features</span>

<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3distributionofsegmentfeatures" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h4><p class="c13"><span class="c14">Of
the 177 segment types in our database, only six exist in all 76
languages: [n], [m], [s], [p], [t], and [k]. But only two (n and m)
exist as major allophones in all languages. The voiceless stops
[p], [t] and [k] are not the major allophones in <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a>, where there
is no voicing contrasts in plosives, and where their most common
realization is as voiced plosives. Moreover, [p] has a very limited
distribution in <a href="/contributions/63">Kinubi</a> and <a href="/contributions/64">Juba Arabic</a> (it does not exist in Arabic
at all), and [t] has a limited distribution in <a href="/contributions/71">Pidgin Hawaiian</a> (it
does not exist in Hawaiian). Thus, there is a lot of
variation.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c16">However, especially for the consonants there is a clear
tendency to be either common or very uncommon: 21 consonants occur
in 52 or more languages (at least two thirds of the languages), and
97 consonants occur in 25 languages or less (i.e. less than one
third). Only 3 consonants occur in the intermediate range. The 21
most common consonants are given in (1) in decreasing order of
commonness, and the three intermediate consonants are given in
(2).</span></p><blockquote class="example" style="font-size:100%;padding-left:1.8em;margin-left:0.3em"><p class="c13" style="text-indent:-2em"><span class="c14">(1)

segments, languages of course typically show segment classes. Thus,
six of our ten segment features are aggregate features that subsume
information from several different segment features: vowel height
distinctions ([e] vs. [ɛ] etc.) (121), nasal vowels (122),
labiodental fricatives [f] and [v] (124), palato-alveolar sibilants
[ʃ] and [ʒ] (125), interdental fricatives [θ] and [ð] (127), and
prenasalized segments [</span><sup><span class="c10">m</span></sup><span class="c10">b], [</span><sup><span class="c10">n</span></sup><span class="c10">d], etc. (129).</span></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c14">Only
four of our features are direct reflections of the individual
segment features in the database: the schwa vowel (123), the voiced
sibilant [z] (126), the palatal nasal (128), the segment [h]
(130).</span></p>
