<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1introduction" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h4><p class="c12">Quite a few languages
throughout the world have a distinction between inclusive and
exclusive person forms, rather than a single nonsingular person
form ‘we’. The inclusive form means ‘you (singular or plural) and
I’, i.e. it includes the hearer, while the exclusive form means
‘he/she/they and I’, excluding the hearer. Sometimes both inclusive
and exclusive forms are called first person forms, but the
inclusive is perhaps better described as “1+2 person”, while the
exclusive form is “1+3 person”.</p><p class="c12">As the corresponding
<i>WALS</i> chapter (<a class="ref-link" data-content="cysouw2005" style="cursor: pointer;">Cysouw 2005</a>) shows, inclusive/exclusive
distinctions occur only sporadically in Africa and Eurasia, but are
common in Austronesian languages and northern Australian languages,
as well as in the Americas. Some examples of the distinction in
these languages are given in Table 1.</p>

<p class="c12"><span class="c20">The case of English-based Melanesian
pidgins and creoles is quite well-known (see, e.g., <a class="ref-link" data-content="keesing1988" style="cursor: pointer;">Keesing 1988</a>,
<a class="ref-link" data-content="siegel2008" style="cursor: pointer;">Siegel 2008</a>), perhaps because it is so transparent to speakers of
English: The exclusive form is</span> <span class="c21">yumi</span><span class="c20">, which evidently comes from English</span>
<span class="c21">you (and)
me</span><span class="c20">. The
exclusive form</span> <span class="c21">mipela</span> <span class="c20">(and similar forms in <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a> and <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a>), by contrast,

have dual and trial forms like</span> <span class="c21">(yu)mitupela</span> <span class="c20">and</span> <span class="c21">(yu)mitripela</span><span class="c20">, like the Oceanic (Austronesian)
languages that were their main substrates, it has long been clear
that the pattern must have been created on the basis of the
substrates.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c20">In <a href="/contributions/46">Zamboanga Chabacano</a>, the
forms</span> <span class="c21">kita</span> <span class="c20">and</span> <span class="c21">kame</span> <span class="c20">were apparently borrowed from the Philippinic language
Hiligaynon. The two other Chabacano varieties do not make the
distinction.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c20">Interestingly, the
inclusive/exclusive distinction was lost in the three Malay-based
varieties in</span> <span class="c21">APiCS</span><span class="c20">.

three</span> <span class="c21">APiCS</span> <span class="c20">languages, there is an inclusive/exclusive distinction that

first case is the curious case of <a href="/contributions/2">Sranan</a>, which has the general
form</span> <span class="c21">wi</span> <span class="c20">(which

form</span> <span class="c21">unu</span><span class="c20">, which
can mean ‘we excluding you’, but also ‘you (plural)’ (see also
Chapter 16 on person syncretism in personal pronouns). The
syncretism between first and second person might be attributable to
West African substrate influence, but the fact that</span>
<span class="c21">unu</span> <span class="c20">in its first person
use is restricted to exclusive use is quite unexpected.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c20">For
    <a href="/contributions/24">Norf’k</a>, <a href="/contributions/24">Mühlhäusler (2013)</a> reports a distinction between</span>

only in the dual, not in the plural. But here it seems somewhat
questionable whether</span> <span class="c21">miienhem</span>
<span class="c20">and</span> <span class="c21">miienher</span>
<span class="c20">should be regarded as fully grammaticalized

grammaticalized to be regarded as exhibiting this distinction
    <a href="/contributions/57">(Ehrhart &amp; Revis 2013)</a>. But since the substrates of <a href="/contributions/57">Tayo</a> are
Austronesian and do show the distinction, this could be a case of
