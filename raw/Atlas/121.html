<body><p class="c10">One interesting
question in vowel systems is how many distinctions of vowel height
(or aperture) are made in a language. The most typical vowel system
in the world’s languages has five vowels and three degrees of
height (i, e, a, o, u) (<a class="ref-link" data-content="maddieson1984" style="cursor: pointer;">Maddieson 1984</a>: 126), but systems with four
degrees (i, e, ɛ, a, ɔ, o, u) are not uncommon either, and even
five degrees (i, ɪ, e, ɛ, a, ɔ, o, ʊ, u) are possible.</p><p class="c10">For this chapter, we
only took major allophones and non-nasal vowels into account,
regardless of length distinctions, and we ignored the central vowel
[ə] (schwa), whose height properties are difficult to determine. We
treated [a], [æ] and [ɑ] as having the same height. Most vowel
systems are symmetrical, but when a system has four heights in the
front range and three heights in the back range, for example, it is
counted as having four heights.</p><p>value-table</p><p class="c10">The map shows both a
lexifier effect and a geographical effect: Languages whose lexicon
is based on English, Dutch, French, and Portuguese show a clear
tendency to have four or even five vowel heights (like the
lexifier), while the other languages show a clear tendency to have
three or even just two vowel heights.</p><p class="c10">In geographical terms,
languages of the Atlantic region tend to have four vowel heights,
while languages of the Asia-Pacific region tend to have fewer vowel
heights.</p><p class="c10">There are exceptions
to these generalizations; in particular, the Atlantic region has
three Portuguese-based languages with three heights (<a href="/contributions/34">Casamancese Creole</a>, <a href="/contributions/33">Guinea-Bissau Kriyol</a>, <a href="/contributions/38">Fa d’Ambô</a>), and six English-based
languages with three heights (<a href="/contributions/4">Nengee</a>, (<a href="/contributions/1">Early</a>) <a href="/contributions/2">Sranan</a>, <a href="/contributions/6">Trinidad English Creole</a>, Nicaraguan and <a href="/contributions/10">San Andres Creole English</a>). But the
languages outside this region with a four-level system are all
Portuguese-, French- or English-based. And the only French-based
language with a three-level system is <a href="/contributions/57">Tayo</a> (in the Pacific). There
are three English-based languages in the Pacific region with a
three-level system (<a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a>, <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a>, <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a>), and one
Portuguese-based language (<a href="/contributions/43">Batavia Creole</a>).</p><p class="c10">In the Atlantic
region, there are two Spanish-based languages (<a href="/contributions/48">Palenquero</a> and
<a href="/contributions/47">Papiamentu</a>) and one African language (<a href="/contributions/59">Sango</a>) with a four-level
system. <a class="ref-link" data-content="parkvall2000" style="cursor: pointer;">Parkvall (2000</a>: 25-27) discusses possible substrate
influences from West African languages on Atlantic creoles, and
<a class="ref-link" data-content="klein2006" style="cursor: pointer;">Klein (2006</a>) notes that creole vowel systems show no tendency to be
particularly small.</p>
