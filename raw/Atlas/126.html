<body><p class="c10">Like other voiced
fricatives (cf. Chapters 124-125), the voiced dental/alveolar
fricative sibilant [z] occurs less widely than its voiceless
counterpart [s]. In fact, [s] is one of the few segment types that
occurs in all 76 languages.</p><p class="c10">The voiced sibilant
[z] is a separate phoneme in English, Dutch (though to a limited
extent), French, and Portuguese, but it does not occur as a phoneme
in Spanish (only as an allophone in front of nasals, such as
<i>mismo</i> ‘self’).</p><p>value-table</p><p class="c10">The <i>APiCS</i>
languages that lack [z] are mostly the Asian languages with a
strong influence of Austronesian languages. But of course, in the
Chabacano varieties the absence of [z] is also due to its absence
in the Spanish lexifier. <a href="/contributions/43">Batavia Creole</a>, <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a> and <a href="/contributions/57">Tayo</a> are
likely to have lost the [z] of their (Portuguese, English and
French) lexifiers due to the influence of Austronesian. Normally
the [z] in lexifier-derived words is replaced by [s], but in
<a href="/contributions/43">Batavia Creole</a> it is replaced by [ʤ], e.g. <i>medja</i> ‘table’
&lt; Portuguese <i>mesa</i>.</p><p class="c10">The Malay varieties
and <a href="/contributions/71">Pidgin Hawaiian</a> have Austronesian lexifiers lacking [z]. In
addition, [z] is missing in the northern pidgins <a href="/contributions/74">Chinuk Wawa</a> and
<a href="/contributions/76">Eskimo Pidgin</a>.</p><p class="c10">In the languages of
the Atlantic region, [z] is mostly present, even in the
Spanish-based <a href="/contributions/47">Papiamentu</a> and <a href="/contributions/73">Media Lengua</a>. In the French-based
languages, it occurs very prominently in word-initial position in
words such as <a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a> <i>zannimo</i> ‘animal’, <a href="/contributions/52">Guyanais</a>
<i>zwazo</i> ‘bird’, <a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a> <i>zitwel</i> ‘star’, <i>zaanfaan</i>
‘child’. This derives from the French plural form, where
vowel-initial words have the article [lez] or [dez], whose last
consonant is interpreted as a root consonant (<i>les animaux</i>
‘animals’, <i>les oiseaux</i> ‘birds’, <i>les étoiles</i> ‘stars’,
<i>les enfants</i> ‘children’).</p>
<p class="c10">
        [z] is missing in
(Early and modern) <a href="/contributions/2">Sranan</a> and in <a href="/contributions/28">Berbice Dutch</a>, as well as in
<a href="/contributions/19">Pichi</a>, and it only occurs as a minor allophone in <a href="/contributions/4">Nengee</a> (where it
is found mostly in ideophones and tends to be replaced by [s]).
Words from English and Dutch with [z] tend to undergo devoicing in
the Guianas, which <a class="ref-link" data-content="parkvall2000" style="cursor: pointer;">Parkvall (2000</a>:31-2) attributes to Akan
influence.</p><p class="c10">In <a href="/contributions/36">Angolar</a>, [z] occurs
only in front of [i], but this is because it has shifted to [ð] in
all other positions (see Chapter 127).</p>
