<body><p class="c10">The sound [h],
variously described as a voiceless glottal fricative or a whispered
approximant, tends to have a restricted distribution. It occurs in
English and Dutch, but only in syllables that carry stress, i.e.
primarily in word-initial position. In most contemporary varieties
of the Romance languages French, Spanish and Portuguese, it does
not occur, though some varieties have a secondary [h] (in Spanish,
deriving from <i>j</i> [x], and in Brazilian Portuguese, deriving
from <i>rr</i>).</p><p class="c10">In Spanish and French,
there used to be an [h] sound (written <i>h</i>) that was lost
fairly recently, and that still existed in many varieties in the
colonial era, in words such as Spanish <i>hecho</i> ‘done’ (from
Latin <i>factum</i>) and French <i>haler</i> ‘pull’ (a loanword
from Franconian). (The older, Latin-derived [h] was lost early in
all Romance languages.)</p><p>value-table</p><p class="c10">In the <i>APiCS</i>
languages, the presence or absence of [h] appears to depend
primarily on the lexifier: Portuguese-based languages generally
lack [h], and the French-based creoles of the Indian Ocean do not
have any instances of [h] inherited from older French. By contrast,
almost all of the English-based languages have [h], even though
this is sometimes unstable and tends to get lost (much as in
southern British English varieties).</p><p class="c10">The Spanish-based
creoles generally have [h] deriving from Spanish [x] (written
<i>j</i> or <i>g</i>), e.g. <a href="/contributions/44">Ternate Chabacano</a> <i>hugá</i> ‘play’
(Spanish <i>jugar</i>), <a href="/contributions/46">Zamboanga Chabacano</a> <i>hénte</i> ‘person’
(Spanish <i>gente</i>), <a href="/contributions/45">Cavite Chabacano</a> <span class="c22">ohas</span> <span class="c23">‘leaves’ (Spanish</span> <span class="c22">hojas</span><span class="c23">), <a href="/contributions/47">Papiamentu</a></span> <span class="c22">muhé</span> <span class="c23">‘woman’</span> and <a href="/contributions/73">Media Lengua</a> <i>muhir</i>
‘woman’ (Spanish <i>mujer</i>). In <a href="/contributions/48">Palenquero</a>, <a href="/contributions/48">Schwegler (2013)</a>
reports that [h] is preserved from earlier or dialectal Spanish in
words like <i>hecho</i> ‘done’.</p><p class="c10">Similarly, in the
French creoles of the Caribbean, [h] is preserved from earlier
French in words such as <i>halé</i> ‘haul, pull’ (in Guadeloupean,
Martinican and <a href="/contributions/53">Louisiana Creole</a>). In <a href="/contributions/49">Haitian Creole</a>, it occurs in
loans such as <i>hoholi</i> ‘sesame’ (cf. Spanish <i>ajonjolí</i>),
but it is marginal and has phonemic status only in the south of
Haiti <a href="/contributions/49">(Fattier 2013)</a>. Earlier French [h] is also preserved in
<a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a>, as in <i>dahor</i> ‘outside’. In the Indian Ocean varieties
Mauritian and <a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a>, a secondary [h] has developed in
the demonstrative/article <i>sa</i>, which is often pronounced
[ha].</p>
