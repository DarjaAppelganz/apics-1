<body><p class="c10">The labiodental
fricatives [f] and [v] have a more limited distribution in the
world’s languages than the labial plosives [p] and [b], so we
expect to find some interesting variation in their occurrence
across <i>APiCS</i>. Here we consider both [f] and [v] and ask to
what extent they occur in our languages.</p><p>value-table</p><p class="c10">31 languages do not
have both [f] and [v] as major allophones, and as in the pair [ʃ/ʒ]
(Chapter 125), it is the voiceless fricative ([f]) that has the
wider distribution, lacking only in seven languages, while [v] is
absent from 16 languages.</p><p class="c10">[f] is lacking (value
4-5) in some Southeast Asian and Pacific languages with
Austronesian and Papuan substrates, as well as in <a href="/contributions/76">Eskimo Pidgin</a> and
<a href="/contributions/65">Chinese Pidgin Russian</a>. Lexifier words with [f] are normally
replaced by [p], e.g. <a href="/contributions/44">Ternate Chabacano</a> <i>plor</i> ‘flower’
(Spanish <i>flor</i>), <i>pamilia</i> ‘family’; <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a>
<i>lip</i> ‘leaf’, <i>pret</i> ‘afraid’.</p><p class="c10">[v] is lacking (value
3 and 5) in a number of Atlantic creoles (<a href="/contributions/28">Berbice Dutch</a>,
<a href="/contributions/48">Palenquero</a>, <a href="/contributions/2">Sranan</a>), though not in the French-based creoles. In
other Atlantic creoles it occurs in a limited way, e.g. <a href="/contributions/34">Casamancese Creole</a>, <a href="/contributions/19">Pichi</a>, <a href="/contributions/13">Gullah</a>, <a href="/contributions/4">Nengee</a>. In the Spanish-based creoles, the
absence or restricted occurrence of [v] is not surprising, because
Spanish has no contrast between [v] and [b]. But in the Dutch-,
English-, and Portuguese-based languages it is less expected, and
<a class="ref-link" data-content="parklvall2000" style="cursor: pointer;">Parkvall 2000</a>: 47-50) discusses possible West African substrate
influences leading to the common replacement of [v] by [b].</p><p class="c10">Quite a few Atlantic
creoles have remnant forms from earlier stages where replacement of
[v] by [b] was more common, e.g. older <a href="/contributions/14">African American English</a>
<i>nebber</i> ‘never’, or Cape Verdean Creole <i>bo</i> ‘you’ (from
Portuguese <i>vós</i>). <a href="/contributions/3">Saramaccan</a> has [v] in words of Portuguese
origin such as <i>véntu</i> ‘wind’, but words of English origin
regularly have [b], e.g. <i>libi</i> ‘live’ <a class="ref-link" data-content="holm1988" style="cursor: pointer;">Holm 1988</a>: 137). See
also Chapter 110.</p><p class="c10">In non-Atlantic
languages, [v] is sometimes replaced by [w], e.g. in Norf’k
(<i>wekels</i> ‘victuals’) and in <a href="/contributions/74">Chinuk Wawa</a>. And a few languages
(especially in South Asia) have the labio-dental approximant [ʋ]
instead (<a href="/contributions/40">Korlai</a>, <a href="/contributions/39">Diu Indo-Portuguese</a>, <a href="/contributions/41">Sri Lanka Portuguese</a>).</p>
